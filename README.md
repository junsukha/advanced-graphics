# Brown csci 2240 Advanced Graphics Final Project
This repo is the final project of csci 2240 Advanced Graphics taught by Professor Daniel Ritchie at Brown.  
I worked on 3d scene reconstruction using voxel-neural field as scene representation.  
You can use the model by running `python main.py`  

`final2.mp4` is the inference images of a scene. `training.mp4` images are training result. `video2.mp4` is the result of testing voxel-neural field using occupancy field on sphere object.
